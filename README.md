Framwork Independence
=====================

Have you ever felt that you always need a framework or a library to do anything?

We have frameworks or libraries for trivial things like left padding a string 
with zeros or spaces and those are project dependencies (yes, I'm talking to you
npm) up to an Android SDK on where we build our products.

But how can I can free my code from them?

Abstraction is the solution, how our dependency graph work and has control over
which part of our code is executed in order to make our products work.
